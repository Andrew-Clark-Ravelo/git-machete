Select the style of the intro prepended to PR description:
* ``full``    --- include both a chain of upstream PRs (typically leading to ``main``, ``master``, ``develop`` etc.) and a tree of downstream PRs
* ``up-only`` --- default, include only a chain of upstream PRs
* ``none``    --- prepend no intro to the PR description at all

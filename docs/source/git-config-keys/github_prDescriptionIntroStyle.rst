Select the style of the generated section ("intro") added to the PR description:
  * ``full``    --- include both a chain of upstream PRs (typically leading to ``main``, ``master``, ``develop`` etc.) and a tree of downstream PRs
  * ``up-only`` --- default, include only a chain of upstream PRs
  * ``none``    --- prepend no intro to the PR description at all
